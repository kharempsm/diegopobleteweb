                <p>
                  Convertion Rate Optimization is a powerful tool that utilizes user analysis and feedback to enhance website performance. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to apply this strategy across various companies, yielding impressive results.
                  <br><br>
                  One company I worked with faced a common challenge: high website traffic but abysmal conversion rates. Following thorough analysis, we identified friction points in the purchasing process and revamped the homepage design to make the call-to-action more prominent. Additionally, we conducted A/B testing to experiment with different elements and continually optimize performance.
                  <br><br>
                  Another company aimed to boost conversion rates on their pricing page. We conducted market research to better understand user preferences and adjusted price intervals and associated features for each plan accordingly. Furthermore, we added a phone number to facilitate quote requests.
                  <br><br>
                  In addition to optimizing specific pages, I've implemented CRO strategies in blog content by incorporating relevant CTAs in popular articles and offering additional content in exchange for visitor contact information. This tactic not only increased conversion rates but also generated higher-quality leads.
                  <br><br>
                  One of the most crucial lessons learned is the importance of setting clear, measurable goals. By utilizing analytical tools, we calculated the current conversion rate and established realistic targets for improvement. This enabled us to track progress and adjust strategies as needed.
                  <br><br>
                  In summary, CRO has been instrumental in online success. Understanding customer and user needs and optimizing their experiences has enhanced conversion rates and generated significant results.

              <p>
                During a routine quarterly review of our website analytics, I noticed some inconsistencies in user interaction data. This raised a red flag, as our website had recently undergone significant architectural updates. I suspected that our existing GA4 tracking setup might not be capturing all user interactions accurately due to these changes. It was crucial to address this proactively to prevent data integrity issues from impacting our business decisions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My immediate task was to conduct a thorough audit of our tracking configuration. I meticulously examined every step of the user journey, mapping out how interactions were being captured (or missed) within GTM and GA4. This involved:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Analyzing GTM configurations:</b> I reviewed all tags, triggers, and variables to ensure they were firing correctly and capturing the intended data.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                This comprehensive audit revealed several areas where data was either missing or inconsistently captured. For example, some key user interactions on newly redesigned pages were not triggering the appropriate events in GA4.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To address these gaps, I collaborated with the development team to implement the following enhancements:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Data layer enrichment:</b> We added more detailed information to the data layer, ensuring that GTM could accurately capture user interactions on the updated pages.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Custom event tracking:</b> We implemented custom events in GTM to track specific user actions that were not being captured by the default GA4 configuration.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                These proactive measures effectively prevented potential data loss and provided a more complete and accurate view of user behavior.

              <br>
              <p>
                I recently worked on a project involving several websites built as Single-Page Applications (SPAs). SPAs present unique challenges for web analytics tracking because users can navigate between different views without triggering traditional page load events. This can lead to inaccurate data on page views and user interactions, making it difficult to understand user behavior and optimize the website effectively.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My main objective was to ensure accurate tracking of user navigation and interaction within these SPAs. I also needed to implement a robust system for triggering tags in specific locations, even without traditional page loads.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To address these challenges, I took the following steps:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Leveraging History Change Triggers:</b> I utilized GTM's "History Change" trigger to capture changes in the URL fragment identifier. This allowed me to track user navigation between different views within the SPA, even though full page reloads weren't occurring.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Implementing Data Layer:</b> I worked closely with the development team to implement a comprehensive data layer that captured key user interactions, such as button clicks, form submissions, and video plays.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Custom Event Tracking:</b> I configured custom events within GTM to capture specific user interactions and trigger tags based on these events. This enabled precise control over tag firing, ensuring that tags were activated only when specific conditions were met.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Thorough Testing and Validation:</b> I rigorously tested the implementation, using debugging to verify that tags were firing correctly and data was being captured accurately.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                And this resulted in:

                <li><strong>Initial SEO Audit:</strong> I analyzed the website using tools like Google Search Console and SEMrush to
                  identify technical issues, content gaps, and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword Research:</strong> I employed advanced keyword research techniques, focusing on long-tail terms
                  and keywords with high purchase intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Optimization:</strong> Collaborated with development teams to improve loading speed, implement
                  schema markup, optimize meta tags, and address crawling errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Strategy:</strong> In close collaboration with the marketing team, we developed an editorial
                  calendar aligned with strategic keywords, prioritizing user-friendly and well-structured content while interlinking
                  new content effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Link-Building:</strong> Designed ethical link-building campaigns through partnerships with relevant sites
                  and the creation of shareable content.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring and Adjustments:</strong> Implemented real-time tracking using Google Analytics 4 and Data
                  Studio to measure impact and make ongoing adjustments.</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              <p>The results of this initiative included:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>90% of strategic keywords</strong> ranking on Google’s first page within six months.</li>
                <li><strong>250% increase in organic traffic.</strong></li>

              <h2>From Zero to Hero: The Evolution of Email Marketing in Commerce Rocks</h2>
              <h5 class="portafolio_subtitle">Associated with Commerce Rocks / May 2021 - Apr 2022</h5>
              <br>
              <p>About 10 months ago, I noticed that the Email Marketing channel at Commerce Rocks was not being fully utilized.
                While
                there was a subscriber database, this channel was not considered one of the primary tools for promoting the
                business.
                Conversions were minimal, and email marketing was not part of the company’s priority sales strategy. In this
                context,
                I was entrusted with the task of improving this channel with the goal of increasing conversions and enhancing its
                overall contribution to the business.</p>
              <br>
              <p>My mission was to increase conversions by at least 40%. To achieve this ambitious goal and transform the email
                marketing channel, I implemented a series of key actions:</p>
              <br>
              <h1>1. Database Segmentation</h1>
              <p>I conducted a detailed segmentation of subscribers based on their purchase behavior, interests, and interaction
                levels with previous emails. This allowed us to create and deliver personalized and relevant content to each
                group.
              </p>
          
              <h1>2. Email Automation</h1>
              <p>I implemented automated email flows, such as abandoned cart reminders, welcome emails, personalized
                recommendations,
                and post-purchase follow-ups. These efforts helped maintain constant and timely communication with customers,
                increasing the conversion rate.</p>
          
              <h1>3. Optimizing Email Design and Content</h1>
              <p>Collaborating with a journalist, I improved the design of the emails to ensure they were visually appealing, easy
                to
                read on mobile devices, and included clear calls to action. Additionally, we created high-value content that
                encouraged users to take action, whether it was making a purchase or engaging with the brand.</p>
          
              <h1>4. A/B Testing to Improve Effectiveness</h1>
              <p>We conducted A/B tests on email subject lines, design elements, and calls to action to determine which components
                had
                the greatest impact on open and click-through rates.</p>
          
              <h1>5. Exclusive Offers and Promotions</h1>
              <p>I designed campaigns with exclusive offers for subscribers, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity. This
                significantly increased interest and immediate action.</p>
          
              <h1>6. Continuous Analysis and Adjustment</h1>
              <p>I performed weekly monitoring and analysis of key metrics (open rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate) to
                identify areas for improvement and make real-time adjustments.</p>
              <br>
              <h1>Results</h1>
              <p>Thanks to this strategic and hard work, the Email Marketing channel not only achieved its goal of improving
                conversions but also increased sales by approximately 450% compared to the starting point. Moreover, it positioned
                itself as the second most important channel, right after SEM, exceeding expectations and becoming a cornerstone of
                Commerce Rocks’ digital strategy.</p>
          
              <p>This project was particularly significant because, despite email marketing not being initially considered a key
                business promotion channel, the outstanding results demonstrated its potential. The channel is now recognized as
                one
                of the most profitable and impactful tools in our campaigns.</p>

              <h2>Transforming the Purchase Journey: Reducing Cart Abandonment and Increasing Average Order Value</h2>
              <h5 class="portafolio_subtitle">Associated with Commerce Rocks / Jul 2021 - Oct 2021</h5>
              <br>
              
              <p>Several months ago, Commerce Rocks faced a shopping cart abandonment rate exceeding 45% and an average order value
                below the industry standard. These metrics directly impacted the business's profitability and growth. Additionally,
                the website exhibited user experience limitations, including lengthy and confusing checkout processes and a lack of
                clear incentives for additional purchases.</p>
              <br>
              <h1>My Approach:</h1>
              <p>I designed and implemented a strategic plan to reduce the cart abandonment rate by at least 20% and increase the
                average order value by 15%. Achieving these goals required identifying friction points, refining the website's
                architecture, and creating data-driven campaigns. The step-by-step initiatives were as follows:</p>
              <br>
              <h1>1. Data Analysis:</h1>
              <p>Using Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager, I pinpointed critical conversion funnel issues, highlighting
                high-abandonment pages and user behavior patterns.</p>
              
              <h1>2. Checkout Process Redesign:</h1>
              <p>After conducting market research to analyze competitors' processes, I simplified the checkout experience by reducing
                the required steps by 45% and eliminating unnecessary distractions. Additionally, I integrated popular and secure
                payment methods, including Bitcoin.</p>
              
              <h1>3. Personalizing User Experience:</h1>
              <p>I implemented A/B testing with Google Optimize, comparing different versions of key pages such as the shopping cart
                and product pages. This involved modifying page designs and advertising copy to enhance user engagement.</p>
              
              <h1>4. Upselling and Cross-Selling:</h1>
              <p>Customized product recommendations were added to the shopping cart, suggesting complementary items and offering
                discounts for bundled purchases to encourage higher spending.</p>
              
              <h1>5. Email Remarketing Automation:</h1>
              <p>I developed an email remarketing campaign targeting users with abandoned carts. These personalized emails included
                limited-time discounts and reminders to return and complete their purchase.</p>
              <br>
              <h1>Results:</h1>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced cart abandonment rate:</strong> A 25% decrease was achieved within three months of implementation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increased average order value:</strong> A 35% increase surpassed the initial target.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved conversion rates:</strong> A/B testing resulted in a finalized version of key pages that
                  significantly boosted the conversion rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced customer feedback:</strong> Customers began reporting a better shopping experience in Google
                  reviews.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="portafolio_subtitle">Associated with Commerce Rocks / Sep 2021 - Jul 2021</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Commerce Rocks is a 100% digital company where digital marketing plays a pivotal role in our sales channel,
                particularly through SEM. Nine months ago, during an in-depth analysis of our campaigns, we identified that while
                traffic volume was high, the conversion rate fell below expectations, and the return on ad spend (ROAS) had room for
                improvement. This insight was largely driven by auction analysis tools that allowed us to understand how much our
                competitors were spending.</p>
              <br>
              <p>We quickly realized that this directly impacted the profitability of our campaigns and the efficiency of our
                marketing budget.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In this context, I took on the challenge of optimizing SEM campaigns to improve conversions while maintaining an
                optimal ROI/ROAS. Although there was no external pressure, I set an ambitious goal for myself: to at least double the
                sales through these channels. Achieving this required a balanced approach to campaign optimization, ensuring every
                dollar or peso spent delivered maximum value.</p>
              <br>
              <h1>Strategies Implemented:</h1>
              <h1>1. Data Analysis:</h1> Reviewed past campaign performance, identified high-performing and low-performing
              keywords, and analyzed audience segmentation.
              <h1>2. Campaign Restructuring:</h1> Redefined campaign structures to focus on more relevant search terms
              aligned with purchase intent, enhancing geographic and device targeting.
              <h1>3. Bid and Budget Optimization:</h1> Implemented automated bidding strategies based on conversions and
              ROAS, reallocating budgets to the best-performing campaigns.
              <h1>4. A/B Testing:</h1> Conducted A/B tests on ads, landing pages, and creative formats to ensure a better
              user experience and higher conversion rates.
              <h1>5. Continuous Improvement and Monitoring:</h1> Conducted weekly KPI reviews and made ongoing adjustments to
              the strategy to boost conversions and ROI.
              <br>
              <h1>Results Achieved:</h1>
              <p>Approximately 6 to 7 weeks after implementing these strategies, we achieved a significant improvement in conversions,
                with conversion rates increasing by up to 8 times. Simultaneously, we maintained optimal ROAS on a monthly basis. This
                progress not only drove continuous sales growth over the past nine months but also optimized our advertising budget,
                maximizing the profitability of each campaign across formats like Search, Display, Shopping, and Video.</p>
              
              <p>This project has further solidified Commerce Rocks as a leader in digital marketing efficiency.</p>

              <p>
                Understanding user segments is crucial for tailoring marketing efforts to specific audiences. However, traditional tools often lack the flexibility to create advanced segments. To address this challenge, I leveraged the powerful audience capabilities of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to build detailed user segments based on behavior, acquisition channels, and engagement levels. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To enhance data capture, I configured GA4 to track specific custom dimensions and employed Google Tag Manager (GTM) to push additional relevant data into these dimensions. This enriched data allowed me to create highly targeted audiences in GA4 for various scenarios. For example, I identified highly engaged users, first-time visitors, and those who exhibited strong purchase intent but ultimately did not convert. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Armed with these granular user segments, I launched targeted campaigns that resonated with each specific group. By tailoring messaging and offers to their unique needs and preferences, we achieved a remarkable increase in campaign ROI. This success story underscores the immense value of utilizing GA4 for strategic user segmentation. By understanding audience at a deeper level, you can create more effective marketing campaigns that drive tangible results.

              <p>
                I collaborated with Google partners to implement Google Analytics 4 and Google Ads, aiming to analyze user behavior and optimize advertising campaigns. Integrating these tools allowed us to gain a comprehensive view of the customer journey, from initial interaction to final conversion. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our primary goal was to improve campaign performance through detailed analysis of user behavior and data-driven optimization. To achieve this, we configured Google Analytics 4 to track key events and conversions on the client’s website. Additionally, we integrated Google Ads with Google Analytics 4 to obtain detailed campaign data and track user interactions with ads. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We utilized the advanced analysis capabilities of Google Analytics 4 to identify user behavior patterns, including cohort analysis and audience segmentation.

              <p>Initially, I encountered situations where I had to repeat information or provide constant clarifications, realizing

                <h1>With colleagues or analytics teams:</h1>
                <p>I used technical and precise vocabulary, delving into the details of web analytics data, A/B test results, and

                  ensured they understood the implications of web analytics data for product development, user experience, and

                <h1>With strategic roles:</h1>

              <p>
                In this project, we implemented and managed programmatic advertising campaigns using Display & Video 360 in
                collaboration with Google partners. Programmatic advertising allowed for more efficient and precise media buying,
                using real-time data to make ad purchase decisions.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Our goal was to increase the reach and efficiency of advertising campaigns through programmatic advertising,
                maximizing the return on advertising investment. We configured Display & Video 360 to manage programmatic advertising
                campaigns, including setting up media inventories, defining target audiences, and creating ads.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                We used demographic, behavioral, and contextual data to create specific audiences, directing ads to the most relevant
                users and increasing the likelihood of conversion. We monitored campaign performance in real-time and made adjustments
                to improve their effectiveness, modifying creatives, adjusting bids, and retargeting audiences.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                We provided detailed reports on campaign performance, including key metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions,
                and cost per acquisition. We used this data to identify improvement opportunities and optimize future campaigns. As a
                result, we achieved greater campaign reach, better advertising spend efficiency, and an increase in conversions.

              <p>
                I was tasked with implementing a website revamp to support a new marketing campaign. The primary challenge was the need to execute this redesign using A/B testing and personalization tools or Google Tag Manager - a non-traditional approach that presented unique complexities. This deviation from standard website development practices required careful planning, meticulous execution, and continuous monitoring to ensure alignment with the campaign's objectives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My role was to lead the implementation and involved:

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducted thorough research on best practices for A/B testing and personalization.</li>
                <li>Developed a detailed project plan outlining the timeline, milestones, and resource allocation.</li>
                <li>Worked closely with the design and development teams to ensure seamless integration of the revamp elements.</li>
                <li>Implemented robust tracking mechanisms to monitor the performance of the website.</li>
                <li>Communicated regularly with stakeholders, providing updates on progress and addressing any concerns.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                The project was a resounding success. We achieved the following outcomes:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Successfully launched the website revamp in alignment with the new marketing campaign.</li>
                <li>Significantly improved user engagement metrics, including time spent on site and conversion rates.</li>
                <li>Gained valuable insights into user preferences, informing future website development strategies.</li>

                This project demonstrated my ability to navigate complex challenges, adapt to unconventional approaches, and deliver impactful results. It underscores my expertise in A/B testing, personalization, and website optimization, as well as my commitment to driving business growth through strategic initiatives.

                This is another project where I had the pleasure of tackling the challenge of data integration. A large e-commerce company was struggling to get a unified view of their customer journey. Their data was siloed across multiple platforms: Google Analytics for website traffic, Salesforce for CRM, and various marketing platforms for campaign data. This made it difficult to understand customer behavior, personalize marketing efforts, and accurately measure campaign ROI.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was an external consultant brought in to lead a data integration project. My task was to design and implement a solution that would bring together data from these disparate sources into a centralized data warehouse. This involved:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Identifying key data points:</b> Working with stakeholders across departments to determine the most important customer attributes and behaviors to track.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                We chose Google Cloud Platform as the foundation for our data integration solution, including:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Analytics</li>

            <br>
            <p>
                The project was a success. The company now has a unified view of its customers, enabling them to:

              <p>
                Our multi-site campaign, spanning diverse domains like e-commerce, content marketing, and social media, was grappling with inconsistent attribution data. This discrepancy hindered our ability to accurately measure the impact of marketing efforts across different channels and platforms. Without reliable attribution, data-driven decision-making was compromised, leading to suboptimal resource allocation and campaign strategies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To rectify this issue, we aimed to establish robust cross-domain tracking that would ensure seamless attribution across all domains. This would enable us to gain a holistic view of the customer journey and pinpoint the touchpoints that contributed to conversions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To achieve this, we undertook the following steps:

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Parameter Integration:</b> We meticulously integrated correct cross-domain tracking parameters into all relevant marketing materials, including website links, email campaigns, and social media posts. This involved ensuring that UTM parameters were properly appended to URLs, allowing us to track user interactions across different domains.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>URL Structure Validation:</b> We meticulously reviewed and validated the URL structures across all domains to identify and rectify any inconsistencies that could hinder accurate tracking. This included standardizing URL formats, removing unnecessary parameters, and ensuring proper encoding of special characters.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                This approach yielded significant benefits:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Get a Clearer Picture:</b> Understand the entire customer journey from start to finish.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Make Smarter Decisions:</b> Use accurate data to allocate budgets and optimize campaigns.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Boost Campaign Performance:</b> Identify top-performing channels and allocate resources effectively.</li>
                <br>

            <p>
                By addressing the inconsistent attribution issue, we empowered our marketing team to make informed decisions, leading to more effective and efficient campaigns.

                I once faced a critical tracking issue just days before a major campaign launch. The stakes were high, as incomplete or inaccurate data could severely impact the campaign’s performance evaluation and decision-making.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I needed to identify and resolve the issue quickly to ensure the campaign tracking was flawless, maintaining stakeholder trust and data reliability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I systematically reviewed the tracking setup, starting from GTM to GA4, checking tag triggers, variables, and real-time data streams. I collaborated closely with the development team to simulate user actions and pinpoint discrepancies. I also implemented debug tools to test event flows and isolate the problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Within hours, I identified a misconfigured event parameter in GTM. After correcting and testing it, tracking was back on track. The campaign launched successfully, with accurate data collection that stakeholders used confidently to make strategic decisions. This incident reinforced my problem-solving skills under pressure.

                As a Google partner, I had the distinct privilege of leading a comprehensive digital transformation project in Dubai for a prominent global company. This ambitious endeavor was centered around the advanced integration of Google Marketing Platform tools with their Salesforce CRM. The primary objective was to revolutionize how the company approached campaign attribution, ensuring seamless alignment and optimization across both platforms. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project was instrumental in enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of campaign attribution within Campaign Manager 360. By integrating these powerful tools, we enabled precise tracking and attribution of leads to their respective traffic sources, thus providing the company with a more granular understanding of customer journeys and the impact of various marketing channels. This level of detail allowed for more informed decision-making and improved the overall efficiency of their marketing efforts. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the key achievements of this project was the implementation of an automated system for updating conversion funnel stages. Each stage of the conversion process was meticulously valued, ensuring that the company could measure and optimize the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns at every step. This automation not only saved time but also enhanced the accuracy of the conversion tracking, enabling a more strategic approach to campaign management. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Moreover, we introduced real-time synchronization of audience data and Salesforce records. This feature allowed the company to respond rapidly to changes in customer behavior, dynamically adjusting their marketing strategies to better align with evolving customer needs and preferences. The ability to make these adjustments in real-time was crucial in maintaining the relevance and effectiveness of their campaigns.

              <p>
                Picture this: I waltz into a new project, ready to dive deep into data-driven insights. But hold on, there's a catch! Our analytics setup was as broad as the Pacific Ocean, offering a panoramic view of user behavior, but no real depth. It was like trying to spot a needle in a haystack, without the haystack.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My mission? To turn this data desert into a fertile oasis. Armed with my trusty GMP toolkit, I embarked on a quest to segment our audience into distinct groups. We sliced and diced our users by demographics, location, device type, and more, creating a detailed user profile for each segment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With our segmented audience in place, we fine-tuned event tracking and conversion goals to capture the nuances of each group's behavior. It was like adding a magnifying glass to our analytics, zooming in on the specific actions and preferences of each user segment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And voila! We transformed our analytics reports from a generic overview to a personalized playbook. The marketing team was thrilled to have a clearer picture of their audience, enabling them to tailor their campaigns with laser-like precision. So, the next time you find yourself lost in a sea of data, remember: a little segmentation can go a long way.

                My goal was to demystify these metrics for non-technical stakeholders, ensuring they could confidently use the dashboard to inform their digital strategies. I also sought to create an ongoing process for regular reporting and education.

            <p>
                <b>1. Clarifying Metrics with Practical Analogies:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I explained the differences between these metrics using simple, relatable terms:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Users:</b> Individual customers entering a store—each unique and counted once.</li>
                <li><b>Sessions:</b> Visits to the store—one customer may visit multiple times.</li>
                <li><b>Page Views:</b> Products the customer browses during a visit.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                This analogy made abstract concepts tangible and easy to grasp.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>2. Providing Context Through Theory:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I paired this with a concise explanation of how these metrics align with the user journey: from acquisition (users) to engagement (sessions and page views). This dual approach helped stakeholders see the “why” behind the numbers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>3. Establishing Weekly Reporting and Collaboration:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To reinforce understanding, I initiated weekly sessions where I presented updated dashboards, clarified doubts, and proposed data-driven opportunities. For instance, if mobile sessions increased but conversions lagged, I’d recommend improving the mobile user experience or refining ad campaigns.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This approach empowered stakeholders to confidently interpret analytics and apply insights to their strategies. They prioritized marketing channels based on acquisition trends and improved engagement through targeted optimizations. Over time, the weekly sessions became a valuable forum for collaboration, fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making.

              <h2>Ensuring Accurate Data Collection by Correcting GTM and Data Layer Implementation</h2>
              <h5 class="portafolio_subtitle">Associated with Google / Jan 2020 - Mar 2020</h5>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                While working on a website optimization project some time ago, I encountered an issue that hindered accurate data collection. The development team had incorrectly implemented the GTM container snippet and data layer, which led to inconsistent and unreliable data in our analytics reports.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The problem stemmed from the placement of the data layer variable <i>after</i> the GTM container snippet in the website's code. This meant that GTM was trying to access data from the data layer before it was actually available.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To address this, I had to explain the issue clearly and guide them on the correct implementation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <b>Explanation:</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I started by emphasizing the importance of the data layer as a communication bridge between the website and GTM. I explained that GTM relies on the data layer to access information about user interactions and page events.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Then, I highlighted the specific issue: the data layer variable was being declared <i>after</i> the GTM container snippet. This meant that when GTM tried to access data from the data layer, it wasn't available yet, leading to errors and inaccurate tracking.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Finally, I provided clear instructions on the correct implementation:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Declare the data layer variable <i>before</i> the GTM container snippet.</b> This ensures that the data layer is available when GTM needs it.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Use <code>dataLayer.push()</code> to add dynamic data.</b> For information that becomes available after the page loads (e.g., link clicks), use <code>dataLayer.push()</code> to add it to the data layer without overwriting existing data.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                After this clarification and guidance, the developers corrected the implementation. This resulted in:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accurate data collection:</b> GTM could now access the data layer correctly, leading to accurate and reliable data in our analytics reports.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Improved data integrity:</b> We had confidence that the data we were collecting accurately reflected user behavior on the website.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Enhanced decision-making:</b> With accurate data, we could make informed decisions about website optimization.</li>
            </ul>

              <h2>Lack of Strategic Tracking Plan</h2>
              <h5 class="portafolio_subtitle">Associated with Google / Feb 2020 - Mar 2020</h5>
              <br>
              
              <p>
                In one project I worked on at Google, I found that the analytics implementation lacked a clear strategic tracking plan. Tracking codes were added without a documented approach (data layer), leading to inconsistent data and unreliable insights. There was no alignment between the tracked metrics and the business objectives, which made it difficult for the team to gauge the impact of their marketing efforts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My responsibility was to assess the current tracking setup, identify gaps, and create a comprehensive measurement plan aligned with the business goals. The goal was to design a system that would capture data in a structured way, enabling meaningful analysis and data-driven decision-making.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I began by conducting a thorough audit of the existing tracking configuration, noting where key actions were either tracked incorrectly or not at all. After identifying the gaps, I collaborated with stakeholders to define clear KPIs and metrics aligned with their objectives. I documented these in a measurement plan and restructured the Google Tag Manager (GTM) setup to ensure that tracking was both systematic and scalable. Each tracked event, page view, or conversion was then mapped directly to a specific business goal, bringing much-needed clarity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This structured approach resulted in more reliable data and allowed us to generate actionable insights. The team could measure user engagement accurately and had a clear view of how digital actions tied back to broader objectives. This not only boosted data integrity but also improved trust in analytics, as stakeholders saw that their data now served strategic purposes.
